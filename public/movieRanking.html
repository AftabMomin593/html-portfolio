<h1>The Best Movies According to Aftab</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Section 375</h3>
<p>The film gives you a deep insight into what goes on in the minds of those holding the position of power, who think it's normal to violate a woman's mind and body with or without her consent.</p>

<h3>Interstella</h3>
<p>The realness of the science in Interstellar makes the film a wonder to behold, as it makes the audience feel as if they are actually getting an inside look at how our universe works. At times, it feels like the world's most expensive documentary, rather than a fictionalized narrative film.</p>

<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Drive' is a visceral and brilliantly executed vision of art-house action; possibly one of the greatest art-house films to have graced the screen. Nicolas Winding Refn has created a stylised neo-noir thriller that is simply stunning; full of glorified violence and stroking imagery.</p>
